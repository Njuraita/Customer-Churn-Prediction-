# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

In this project, we aim to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. By identifying the factors influencing churn, we strive to build a reliable model that provides actionable insights for businesses to enhance their customer retention strategies.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

## Key Metrics and Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: The model should have an accuracy score of at least 80% best at >85%
2. **Precision and Recall**: Achieve at least 80% to ensure reliable churn prediction and identification.
3. **F1 Score**: Minimum of 0.75 to balance precision and recall, especially for imbalanced classes.
4. **AUC-ROC Score**: At least 0.85 to effectively distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: Lower the number of False Negatives (FN) to ensure most churn cases are identified.

### Load Datasets 

*The data is located in 3 different locations;*
- MySQL Database 3000 train dataset
- A csv in a github repo 2000 train data
- A csv in onedrive- test data

#### Loading the SQL Data 

```dotnetcli
# Load environment variables from .env file into a dictionary
environment_variables = dotenv_values (r'C:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\OneDrive-Azubi\Customer-Churn-Prediction-\.env')

# Get the values for the credentials you set in the '.env' file
server = environment_variables.get('SERVER')
database = environment_variables.get('DATABASE')
username = environment_variables.get('USERNAME')
password = environment_variables.get('PASSWORD')

# Create a connection string
connection_string = f"DRIVER={{SQL Server}};SERVER={server};DATABASE={database};UID={username};PWD={password};MARS_Connection=yes;MinProtocolVersion=TLSv1.2;"


connection = pyodbc.connect(connection_string)
```

```dotnetcli
# Loading the First 3000 dataset
query = "SELECT * FROM LP2_Telco_churn_first_3000"

data = pd.read_sql(query, connection)

data.head()
```

#### Loading train Data from the csv

``` 
# Loading the second 2000 data
df=pd.read_csv('../data/LP2_Telco-churn-second-2000.csv')
df.head()
```

#### Merge Data

```
# Combine DataFrames
churn_prime = pd.concat([data, df], ignore_index=True)

churn_prime.head()

```


<<<<<<< HEAD
After Merging the train data we did some data inspection using funstions such as .info(), .shape, .describe(), .isnull(), .duplicated()


#### Hypothesis Testing

#### Chi-Square Test
- **Hypothesis**:
  - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in churn rates among customers with different contract types.
  - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in churn rates among customers with different contract types.
- **Result**:
  - Chi-Square Statistic: 881.6208905118242
  - P-value: 3.61789584641233e-192
  - Degrees of Freedom: 2
  - Conclusion: The p-value is extremely low, providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis for all contract types tested, indicating a significant difference in churn rates among customers with different contract types.

#### Handling Missing Values

- The `TotalCharges` column's missing values are filled with the median.
- Missing values in categorical columns (`MultipleLines`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`, `Churn`) are filled with the mode.
- The `customerID` column is dropped as it does not provide statistical or computational significance.

#### Final Data Check

- The dataset has no duplicated rows.
- The dataset is not evenly distributed, with mean and median significantly differing for numerical columns.
- The dataset contains outliers as seen in the long tails of KDE plots and histograms for `TotalCharges`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Insights

- **Churn Distribution**: The churn rate is higher among customers with multiple services.
- **Tenure and Churn**: Most customers tend to churn early; those who stay longer are less likely to churn.
- **Payment Methods and Churn**: There is a significant difference in churn rates among customers with different payment methods.
- **Demographics and Churn**: Customers with different demographic factors (e.g., gender, senior citizen status) show varied churn rates.
- **Internet Service and Churn**: The type of internet service impacts churn rates.
- **Contract Type and Churn**: Different contract types show varied churn rates, with month-to-month contracts having higher churn.

### Data Transformation

### Encoding Categorical Variables

- Categorical columns are encoded using appropriate encoding techniques to prepare the data for modeling.

### Handling Imbalanced Data

- The dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with non-churn instances significantly outnumbering churn instances.

### Data Splitting

- The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split, with stratification to maintain the distribution of the target variable.

#### Skewness Check

- Numeric features show varying levels of skewness, indicating the need for appropriate scaling or transformation.

#### Target Encoding

- The target variable `y` is encoded using `LabelEncoder` to prepare it for modeling


## Data Preprocessing

### Scaling Decision

- Standard Scaler was disqualified due to non-normal distribution of data.
- MinMax Scaler was disqualified due to the presence of outliers.
- Robust Scaler was chosen to handle biases in the training data.
- Quantile Transformer was used to transform the data to a more evenly distributed shape.

## Feature Engineering

*Numerical and categorical features were processed separately:*

```csharp-interactive


numeric_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', RobustScaler()),
    ('QuantileTransformation', QuantileTransformer()),
])

categorical_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('encoder', OneHotEncoder()),
])

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[
    ('num_pipeline', numeric_pipeline, numerical_columns),
    ('cat_pipeline', categorical_pipeline, categorical_columns),
])
``` 

## **Model Training and Evaluation**

### Initial Training on Imbalanced Data

*Multiple models were trained on imbalanced data:*

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Neural Network

*The initial results showed a bias towards the majority class ("No" churn)*
*Addressing Class Imbalance*
*SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to balance the dataset*

#### Model Performance on Balanced Data

| Model              | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1-Score |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| KNN                | 0.685828 | 0.757547  | 0.685828| 0.703403 |
| Neural Network     | 0.758176 | 0.774210  | 0.758176| 0.764313 |
| Logistic Regression| 0.753221 | 0.808432  | 0.753221| 0.766126 |
| SVM                | 0.762141 | 0.793921  | 0.762141| 0.771759 |
| GBM                | 0.783944 | 0.801629  | 0.783944| 0.790134 |
| Random Forest      | 0.790882 | 0.791642  | 0.790882| 0.791254 |


#### Key Findings

- All models achieved relatively high accuracy scores (0.686 to 0.791) on balanced data.
- Random Forest performed best in accuracy (0.791) and F1-score (0.791).
- Logistic Regression and GBM showed the highest precision (0.808 and 0.802 respectively).
- Random Forest and GBM achieved the highest recall scores (0.791 and 0.784)

#### Model Comparison and Recommendations

- Random Forest and GBM consistently performed well across all metrics.
- Logistic Regression and SVM demonstrated strong performance with high precision scores.
- Neural Network showed competitive performance but slightly lower precision.
- KNN exhibited the lowest recall among the models.

### Conclusion in Regards to Modeling and Evaluation

- Ensemble methods (Random Forest and GBM) are recommended for their balanced performance across all metrics. They are particularly suitable for applications where F1-score is the primary consideration.


### Hperparameter Tuning 

#### Hyperparameter Tuning Results

#### Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)

- **Error Handling:** The error messages encountered during trials were due to setting `'max_features': 'auto'`, which is not compatible with `cross_val_score` in scikit-learn. This issue will be addressed in future tuning iterations.

- **Optimization Progress:** Despite encountering errors in some trials, the study completed all 100 trials as specified (`n_trials=100`).

- **Best F1-Score:** The best F1-score observed during the study was **0.794**, achieved in Trial 63, which represents a slight improvement.

#### Random Forest

- **Trial Number:** Trial 99 was the 99th trial conducted during the optimization process.

- **Trial Result:** The F1-score observed for Trial 99 was **0.6353**.

- **Best Trial:** The best F1-score observed overall throughout all trials was **0.6424**, achieved in Trial 40.

- **Performance Drop:** There was a drop in F1 Score from an initial 0.791 to 0.642, indicating a need for further hyperparameter adjustment to enhance performance.

#### Challenges and Moving Forward 

- The only Major Challenge was with the hyperparameter tunings of our 2 best performing models which we will seek to work it out with the best hyperparameters so that we can move forward to sellecting the best model for our test data
- Other Challenges were learning oportnities :blush:
- We will also be exporting core machine learning Components for future use in other projects
