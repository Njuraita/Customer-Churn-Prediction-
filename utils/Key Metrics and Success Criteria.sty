Key Metrics and Success Criteria
To Edit On the Go

     -The Model should have an accuracy score of 85% (On balanced data)
     Good models are expected to have an accuracy score of >0.80 or 80%

     -An ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) score of 80% or 0.80 is ideal for the model to perform well.

     -There should be at least four baseline models to compare performance and ensure robustness. eg. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) 

     -All hyperparameter tuning should only be applied if it exceeds the baseline model's F1 score. The F1 score balances precision and recall and is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

     -Confusion Matrix Analysis- Evaluate True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) to understand model performance in detail.
     Aim to minimize FN (churned customers predicted as non-churned) to reduce customer loss

     -Precision and Recall- High precision indicates a low false positive rate.
     High recall indicates a low false negative rate.
     Both metrics should be balanced for effective churn prediction.

     -F1 Score- Particularly useful for imbalanced dataset- as such we have-we aim for an F1 score that indicates balanced performance between precision and recall
     
     -Cross-Validation Scores-Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability and performance consistency across different subsets of the data.
     High and consistent cross-validation scores indicate a robust model
     -Lift and Gain Charts-Use these charts to measure the effectiveness of the model in identifying true churners.
      Higher lift and gain values indicate better model performance in distinguishing between churners and non-churners.
